== pyBBN ==

This software is a _work-in-progress_ experiment on implementing the particle physics simulations\
using Python. It is designed to model the weak processes in the Early Universe that precede the\
primordial nucleosynthesis (Big Bang Nucleosynthesis, BBN).

To accomplish this, it solves a system of integro-differential Boltzmann kinetic equations coupled\
to the cosmological equations of the Friedmann–Lemaître–Robertson–Walker Universe.

This project is aimed at testing the predictions of a number of particle physics models like \
$\nu MSM$ (Neutrino Minimal Standard Model) by comparing their influence on the BBN observables\
(yields of the light nuclei; \
 $^1 \mkern-2mu H, \, ^2 \mkern-2mu H, \, ^3 \mkern-2mu H, \, ^4 \mkern-2mu He, \, B, \, Li$)
