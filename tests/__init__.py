== Functioning simple tests: ==

  * [Photon universe](photon_universe/index.html) (perfect)
    :   radiation equilibrium physics and expansion
  * [Electron universe](electron_universe/index.html) (good)
    :   electrons equilibrium physics and expansion around the moment of their disappearance
  * [Neutron universe](neutron_universe/index.html) (_questions on physics_)
    :   dust equilibrium physics and expansion
  * [Photon-electron universe](photon_electron_universe/index.html) (perfect)
    :   check that electron-positron annihilation influences on the system entropy
  * [Cosmic neutrino background temperature](cosmic_neutrino_temperature/index.html) (good)
    :   check that additional particles do not spoil the temperature ratio `1.401`

== Planned simple tests: ==

  * Test expansion of the free non-equilibrium species
  * Thermalization test (equilibrium distribution with a "bump")
  * Neutron decay test
  * Neutrino self-scattering test

== Planned complex tests: ==

  * Check previous results for single sterile neutrino species
  * Test two-body decays
